# Vision-Based UAV Navigation (Simulation)

 **Work in Progress** 

This repository contains an **ongoing project** focused on developing a vision-based navigation framework for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a purely simulated environment. The goal is to study how visual perception can be used for autonomous navigation without relying on external positioning systems such as GPS.

The project is being built from scratch with an emphasis on understanding fundamentals and research-oriented development.

## Project Objectives

* Simulate a UAV in a physics-based environment
* Mount a virtual onboard camera on the UAV
* Process camera images using computer vision techniques
* Use visual information for navigation and control
* Visualize UAV trajectory and perception outputs


## Key Concepts Involved

* UAV dynamics and simulation
* Camera modeling in simulation
* Image processing and feature extraction
* Vision-based navigation logic
* Feedback control for motion

## Technologies Used

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **PyBullet** – Physics-based simulation engine
* **OpenCV** – Computer vision and image processing
* **NumPy** – Numerical computation
* **scikit-image** – Image processing utilities
* **Matplotlib** – Visualization and plotting



This repository is **actively being developed**, and features will be added incrementally.
